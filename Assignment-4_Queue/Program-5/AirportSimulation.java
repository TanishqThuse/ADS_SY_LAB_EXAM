/**Q4) 5)Write a program which simulates the operation of a busy airport which
has only two runways to handle all takeoffs and landings. You may
assume that each takeoff or landing takes 15 minutes to complete. One
runway request is made during each five minute time interval and
likelihood of landing request is the same as for takeoff. Priority is given
to planes requesting a landing. If a request cannot be honored it is added
to a takeoff or landing queue. Your program should simulate 120
minutes of activity at the airport. Each request for runway clearance
should be timeÂ­stamped and added to the appropriate queue. The output
from your program should include the final queue contents, the number
of take offs completed, the number of landings completed, and the
average number of minutes spent in each queue.
