/*Q4) 4)Write a menuÂ­driven program that maintains a queue of passengers
waiting to see a ticket agent. The program user should be able to insert a
new passenger at the rear of the queue, display the passenger at the front
of the queue, or remove the passenger at the front of the queue. The
program will display the number of passengers left in the queue just
before it terminates. */
